# /phase-commit

Generate comprehensive conventional commit message for Phase 2 feature completion.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ PURPOSE

Create detailed, structured commit messages following Only1MCP's established pattern for Phase 2 feature commits.

---

## ðŸ“‹ EXECUTION

### Step 1: Analyze Changes

```bash
# Check git status
git status

# Review changes
git diff --stat
git diff --cached --stat

# View recent commits for pattern
git log --oneline -3
```

### Step 2: Read Context

```bash
# Understand feature details
cat CLAUDE.local.md | grep -A 20 "Session.*COMPLETE"

# Identify feature number
cat to-dos/Phase_2/PHASE_2_MASTER_PLAN.md | grep -E "Feature [0-9].*âœ…"
```

### Step 3: Generate Commit Message

Use this template, filling in actual details:

```

## ðŸŽ¯ COMMIT MESSAGE PATTERNS

### Commit Types
- `feat`: New feature implementation
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation updates only
- `test`: Test additions or fixes
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without behavior change
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `chore`: Maintenance (dependencies, build, etc.)

### Summary Line Guidelines
- Start with type: `feat: Implement ...`
- Use imperative mood: "Implement" not "Implemented"
- Max 72 characters
- Describe WHAT not HOW
- No period at end

### Body Guidelines
- Comprehensive technical details
- Use present tense: "Adds" not "Added"
- Include metrics and measurements
- List all significant files
- Document all architectural decisions
- Provide context for future developers
