## üîß Technical Specifications

### Load Balancing Algorithms

```rust
pub enum LoadBalancingStrategy {
    RoundRobin,
    WeightedRoundRobin { weights: HashMap<String, u32> },
    LeastConnections,
    ConsistentHash { virtual_nodes: u32 },
    AdaptiveLatency { window: Duration },
    Random,
}
```

### Circuit Breaker Configuration

```yaml
circuit_breaker:
  failure_threshold: 5

## üöÄ Implementation Guidelines

### Design Principles
1. **Zero-Copy**: Use reference counting and borrowing
2. **Lock-Free**: Prefer atomic operations and arc-swap
3. **Async-First**: All I/O operations must be async
4. **Fail-Fast**: Early validation and error detection

### Code Standards
- Use `#[instrument]` for all public functions
- Implement `Display` and `Debug` for all types
- Add metrics for all operations
- Document panic conditions

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all algorithms
- Integration tests for each feature
- Chaos testing for resilience
- Load testing for performance

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Cache invalidation bugs | Data inconsistency | Implement version keys |
| Circuit breaker flapping | Service instability | Add hysteresis |
| Memory leaks in cache | OOM crashes | Set hard limits |
| Metric cardinality explosion | Performance degradation | Label limits |

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Feature Flags**: Gate new features behind flags
2. **Gradual Rollout**: Deploy to % of traffic
3. **Rollback Plan**: Keep previous version ready
4. **Monitoring**: Alert on anomalies immediately
