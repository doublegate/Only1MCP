## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. Proxy Server (src/proxy/server.rs)
```rust
pub struct ProxyServer {
    config: Arc<Config>,
    registry: Arc<RwLock<ServerRegistry>>,
    router: Arc<RequestRouter>,
    health: Arc<HealthChecker>,
}
```

#### 2. Request Flow
```
Client Request → Axum Router → Request Handler
    ↓
Route Selection (consistent hash/least-conn)
    ↓
Transport Selection (STDIO/HTTP/WebSocket)
    ↓
Backend Communication
    ↓
Response Aggregation → Client Response
```

#### 3. Configuration Schema
```yaml
servers:
  - id: github
    transport: stdio
    command: github-mcp
    health_check:
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s

proxy:
  routing:
    algorithm: consistent_hash
    virtual_nodes: 150
  health:
    check_interval: 10s
    failure_threshold: 3
```

### Performance Targets
- **Latency:** <5ms proxy overhead
- **Throughput:** 1,000 req/s minimum
- **Memory:** <50MB for 10 servers
- **CPU:** <5% idle, <25% under load

### Security Requirements
- STDIO process sandboxing
- Resource limits enforcement
- No privilege escalation
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Rate limiting (60 req/min default)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Process management complexity**
   - Mitigation: Use tokio::process with careful lifecycle management
   - Fallback: Limit to HTTP transport initially

2. **Performance bottlenecks**
   - Mitigation: Profile early and often
   - Fallback: Reduce virtual nodes, simplify routing

3. **Memory leaks in long-running processes**
   - Mitigation: Implement process recycling
   - Fallback: Periodic restart strategy

### Schedule Risks
1. **Tokio async complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with simpler sync where possible
   - Buffer: 2 days allocated for async issues

2. **Health checking accuracy**
   - Mitigation: Start with simple ping/pong
   - Enhancement: Advanced health in Phase 2
